## inkterop

`tests/fixtures/goodnotes/gn-mac-mixed-pens.goodnotes` is redistributed
unchanged from the inkterop project, where it is a controlled GoodNotes 6
(Mac App Store) export used as a format fixture. Riffle's Goodnotes
support in `riffle/goodnotes_*.py` is an independent implementation, but
the container layout, page/event model and geometry-signature facts it
relies on were established by inkterop's published reverse-engineering
notes (`docs/formats/goodnotes.md`). Those notes in turn credit
[franzthiemann/goodparse](https://github.com/franzthiemann/goodparse) for
first documenting the container layout, LZ4 framing and stroke-triplet
encoding; goodparse's source code was not read or reused here.

## goodnotes-pdf-engine

The reading of a Goodnotes page's background reference (paper record field 4
= attachment id, field 5 = page number inside that attachment) was
cross-checked against
[fakeminjun7321/goodnotes-pdf-engine](https://github.com/fakeminjun7321/goodnotes-pdf-engine)
(MIT), which is not a dependency of Riffle.
